//Part 1

// Create a program to get the users height in meters and weight in kilograms and calculate the BMI of the user.
// The formula to calculate the BMI is weight / (height * height).
// The program should then display the BMI of the user and display the following message based on the BMI:
// BMI < 18.5: Underweight
// 18.5 <= BMI < 25: Normal
// 25 <= BMI < 30: Overweight
// BMI >= 30: Obese

//Test Data
//Enter your height in meters: 1.75
//Enter your weight in kilograms: 68
//Your BMI is 22.2
//You are Normal



//Part 2

// Modify the program to get the users height in feet and inches and weight in pounds and calculate the BMI of the user.
// The formula to calculate the BMI is (weight * 703) / (height * height).
// The program should then display the BMI of the user and display the following message based on the BMI:
// BMI < 18.5: Underweight
// 18.5 <= BMI < 25: Normal
// 25 <= BMI < 30: Overweight
// BMI >= 30: Obese

//Test Data
//Enter your height in feet: 5
//Enter your height in inches: 9
//Enter your weight in pounds: 150
//Your BMI is 22.1
//You are Normal

//Part 3

//In a game, the player's score is stored as an integer, but you need to display it with one decimal place. Convert the player's score from an integer to a double and print the result.

//Test Data
//Player's Score: 100
//Player's Score with one decimal place: 100.0

//Part 4
//In a game, the player's health is stored as a double, but you need to display it as a percentage (integer value). Convert the player's health from a double to an integer representing a percentage and print the result.

//Test Data
//Player's Health: 0.75
//Player's Health as a percentage: 75%


//Part 5

//In a game, the player's coins are stored as a double, but you need to display them as an integer (rounded down). Convert the player's coins from a double to an integer and print the result.

//Test Data
//Player's Coins: 123.45
//Player's Coins as an integer: 123

//Part 6

//In a game, the player's progress is stored as a boolean (true for completed, false for incomplete), but you need to display it as a string ("Completed" or "Incomplete").
//Convert the player's progress from a boolean to a string representing the status and print the result.
//Hint: Use a conditional statement to check the boolean value and return the appropriate string. e.g ., if (progress) { return "Completed"; } else { return "Incomplete"; }

//Test Data
//Player's Progress: true
//Player's Progress as a string: Completed
